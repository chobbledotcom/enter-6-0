# EnteR 6.0

## SYSTEM UPDATE 6.0

The next generation of fairground audio. Engineered from the ground up for maximum impact.

---

### LOW END

12 x 21" ultra-long throw subs. Custom-designed front grills. Reinforced internal bracing. Engineered for deep, clean impact at extreme SPL.

### MIDS

8 x 15" mid cabinets delivering chest-hit bass with zero distortion. Laser-cut custom grills. Optimized ports for faster transient response.

### TOP END

4 x dual compression drivers for razor-sharp clarity. 4 x dual 10" coaxials providing spatial imaging that tracks the entire ride movement.

### POWER

5 x Powersoft T904S amplifiers. DSP locked to EnteR's signature curve. Limiter profiles built for long sessions at high output. Total control. Zero sag. Maximum punch.

### THE BUILD

Every grill is custom-made. Every cabinet wrapped in scratch-resistant, impact-resistant material. Not generic. Not catalog. Built for the road.
